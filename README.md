# OneInventory Front-End

> OneInventory front-end is built with ReactJS, Redux, and AntDesign. User type the URL of the web site the home page of the system is displayed. The home page accepts the login information from the user like user name and password. Also on the home page if the user want to become the supplier the option to sign up is there on the home page. The Main Menu is displayed when the user successfully logs on to the system based on user role. As observed in the functional requirements analysis section, the core business functionality supported by the system is inventory management and inventory transfer.
> The application would also provide inventory tracking and reporting features. It was analyzed that the inventory manager could view the inventory level and then the user go to create purchase order screen and create order and add product to be ordered and send it to supplier.

The main page for admin user contain links to create stores, categories,brands and to manage users and company information. The main page for supplier user contain link received purchase order form inventory manager and add sale order to send the sale order to inventory manager. The main page for corporate manager contain links to view available inventory in each store and the weekly conception of each store. Also the Main Menu for inventory manager user contain links for create inventory, inventory products and to receive sale order from supplier. Hence, by the above design, the user would have the ability to view the links based on his or her role.
